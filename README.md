Tools for editing tree structures using a relational model.
Not yet complete, but usable

### General purpose:

Trees are represented internally with two sets: (relational structure)

* Relations: `[{"Parent":id, "Child":id, "Kind":any, ...}, ...]`
* Nodes: `{"id":{... your data ... }, ...]`

The `id` values are assigned internally and don't conflict with or get written to your objects.

Functions given to split a POJO into this structure, and merge the structure into a POJO.

Names of object tree parts, as used below:
```javascript
{ // this object is the parent, it has one property "I" = "am parent"

    "I" : "am parent", // properties (whose values are not objects) remain
                       //   on the containing object.

    "Kind" : // properties (whose values are objects) become relationships.
             // The key becomes the kind of the relation.
    {
        // this object is the child
        "Property" : "Value"
    }
}
```

Properties with array values are treated one of two ways:
```javascript
{
    "JustAProperty" : ["hello", 1,2,3], // first element is NOT an object.
                                        // Entire array is a single value,
                                        //   one of the parent's properties
    "OneToMany" : [
        {"child":1}, // First element is an object. All elements are
                     //   considered children of the parent. Kind is 'OneToMany'
        {"child":2}  // There is no way to express many-to-one, and
                     //   putting this in the relational structure is not supported.
    ]
}
```

### Operations on POJO structure:

#### Input

- [x] Decompose -- turn a normal js object tree into the relational structure
- [x] DecomposeWithIds -- same as `decompose` but use a function to pick ids. In case you want to use the relational model externally. It's up to you to ensure the ids are unique

### Operations on the relational structure:

#### Output

- [x] Compose -- put a decomposed tree back together how it was. The composed object will contain auto-generated keys if any were created
- [x] Render -- pass each node through a function, and each kind name through a function and compose tree from the results
- [x] Harvest -- return an object of composed sub-trees by kind, keyed by a parent node value
- [ ] Gather -- return an array of sub-trees 
    - [ ] GatherByKind
    - [ ] GatherByNode

#### Manipulation

- [x] Prune -- remove subtrees by relationship kind
    - [x] PruneAfter -- remove subtrees by relationship kind, but keep the immediate children
    - [x] PruneAllBut -- remove subtrees that **don't** match a set of kinds
- [x] Chop -- remove subtrees by data predicate
    - [x] ChopAfter -- remove subtrees by data predicate, but keep the matched children
- MergeUp -- remove a relationship and one node by merging data from child to parent. Subtree remains
    - [x] MergeUpByKind -- select merge targets by relationship kind
    - [x] MergeUpByNode -- select merge targets by applying a predicate to nodes
- MergeDown -- remove a relationship and one node by merging data from parent to child. Subtree remains
    - [x] MergeDownByKind -- select merge targets by relationship kind
    - [x] MergeDownByNode -- select merge targets by applying a predicate to nodes
- [ ] Fuse -- remove a node by merging into it's parent and child (by supplied function)
    - [ ] FuseAway -- remove a node by connecting it's parents to it's children, losing the data in the selected nodes
        - [ ] FuseAwayByNode
        - [ ] FuseAwayByKind
    - [x] FuseByNode -- remove a node picked by a predicate on that node
    - [x] FuseByKind -- remove a node picked by kind
- [ ] Graft -- insert new subtrees
- [ ] Disconnect -- the opposite of Fuse, place a new node between a parent and child
- [ ] Fork -- move some of the values of a node into a new or existing sibling
- [ ] Move -- move some of the values of a node into an existing sibling, or do nothing
- [x] FlipRelationship -- given a parent kind, a child kind, and an equality function for children; swap parentsâ‡”children, grouping children by equality. 
- [ ] EditPath -- given a path of kinds and a func node->node, replace data at those paths
- [x] Reduce -- reduce objects to a single value from inside them, by kind or node predicate (` {a:[{x:1},{x:2}]} -> {a:[1,2]} `)


Note:
* To run istanbul on Windows, use `istanbul cover C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\mocha\bin\_mocha -- -R spec`

Todo:
* optimisations
* a good way to find subtrees based on paths, and perform operations based on results
* bring `.d.ts` file up-to-date with available features
* syntax should allow chaining of functions
* extend with `kind` *and* `predicate` functions
* some way of mutating kind when fusing/merging?
